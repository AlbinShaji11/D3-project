How to run the Dashboard using Live Server in VS Code

1.File needs to be placed in the same folder (HTML file and CSV files).

2.Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

3.Install the free Live Server extension (Ritwick Dey) if it’s not already installed.

4.In the Explorer pane, right-click html file and ‘Open with Live Server’. Live Server spins up a local web server and automatically opens 
the dashboard in your default browser.

5.All CSV data will be fetched, scripts, and interactive features will now run without additional setup.


(If you prefer the command line, you can still run python -m http.server 8000 and visit http://localhost:8000/html file.)
